<p>Design Process:</p>
<p>I aimed to have all the relevant information on the web page. So I built out the deaths points first, then the pumps, then the streets. Then I built out barcharts for each age, day, and gender. I used similar code structures for all of them. I used basic parsing logic and d3 functions to build out each set of visualizations and information.</p>
<p>Design Choices:</p>
<p>I wanted the visualization to be as simple and as effective as possible. The pumps were made blue because of water. But the genders were given different colors to distinguish them from one another. I also wanted for sensitivity sake to make the colors gender neutral. So male became red and female was green. Also each bar graph was given varying colors to distinguish them from one another as well as fill.</p>
<p>Facts Learned: </p>
<p>I learned a lot about the Cholera map of John Snow. It showed the link between contaminated water and cholera. The visualization shows how important public health policies that improve water sanitation are. It was cool to digitally reproduce this map. I learned a lot about the actual situation. Building out the map helps the creator feel like they really know the process and situation much more than just simply looking at the map. </p>
